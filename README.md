# What Is This?
An nteract presentation cell communicates with a Jupyter kernel, running via Binder. The Binder environment includes the Abjad API for Formalized Score Control.

This is an [nCoda](https://ncodamusic.org/) project, created in collaboration with [nteract](https://nteract.io/).

# Live Version
Click in the presentation cell and press shift+enter to access [a live version of this web app](https://practical-react-ccmrudhuol.now.sh/).
